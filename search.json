    "title": "How bad is this year’s NBA rookie class from previous seasons?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This season’s NBA rookie class is widely considered one of the weakest in recent memory. With previous years drafts highlighted by the likes of Victor Wembanyama and Paolo Banchero, the 2024 class lacked the big-name value.\nThe top two picks — Zaccharie Risacher and Alex Sarr — were rather unknown to a majority of fans despite coming from France like Wembanyama. The batch of college athletes was also underwhelming with guys like Reed Sheppard and Donovan Clingan having upside, but not being worthy of the No. 1 pick.\nHowever, now that these rookies are a few months into their NBA careers, it is worth seeing how they stack up compared to previous classes.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\nLet’s first look at scoring. How do the 2024 rookies fare against the 2023 and 2022 players in their first years? We are able to find out by using their points per game and field goal percentage.\n\n\nCode\nRookies25 &lt;- read_csv(\"2425rookies.csv\")\n\nRookies24 &lt;- read_csv(\"2324rookies.csv\")\n\nRookies23 &lt;- read_csv(\"2223rookies.csv\")\n\nScoring24 &lt;- Rookies24 |&gt; \n  filter(PTSPG &gt; 7)\n\nScoring25 &lt;- Rookies25 |&gt; \n  filter(PTSPG &gt; 7)\n\nScoring23 &lt;- Rookies23 |&gt; \n  filter(PTSPG &gt; 7)\n\ntotalscoring &lt;- rbind(Scoring23, Scoring24, Scoring25)\n\nRookiesnew &lt;- totalscoring |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Jared McCain\" |\n    Player == \"Jaylen Wells\" |\n    Player == \"Dalton Knecht\" |\n    Player == \"Zaccharie Risacher\" |\n    Player == \"Stephon Castle\" |\n    Player == \"Zach Edey\" |\n    Player == \"Alex Sarr\" |\n    Player == \"Yves Missi\" |\n    Player == \"Carlton Carrington\" |\n    Player == \"Kyshawn George\" |\n    Player == \"Tristan Da Silva\" |\n    Player == \"Kyle Filipowski\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = totalscoring, aes(x = `FG%`, y = PTSPG), color = \"black\") + \n  geom_point(data = Rookiesnew, aes(x = `FG%`, y = PTSPG), color = \"red\")  +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = Rookiesnew,\n    aes(x = `FG%`, y = PTSPG, label = Player),\n    color = \"black\"\n   )  + theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"Points per Game\",\n       x = \"Field Goal Percentage\",\n       title = \"The 2024 rookie class is struggling out of the gate compared to previous years.\",\n       subtitle = \"Only 12 players so far averaging over 7 points per game with half shooting under 45%.\",\n       caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Anthony Rubek\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, the new kids on the block are struggling to get out of the gate. Of the seven points per game minimum to make this chart, only 12 players from this season qualify compared to 20 in 2023 and 22 in 2022 CHECK. Half of the 2024 players are also not shooting efficiently, hovering around the 40% range. Of the rookies, only Philadelphia’s Jared McCain is averaging over 14 points per game.\nAnother thing to look at is the amount of time the rookies are on the court. The better they are, the more they will play regardless of age.\n\n\nCode\nminutes25 &lt;- read_csv(\"2425rookies.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter(G &gt; 9)\n\nminutes24 &lt;- read_csv(\"2324rookies.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter(G &gt; 32)\n\nminutes23 &lt;- read_csv(\"2223rookies.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter(G &gt; 32)\n  \nminutes22 &lt;- read_csv(\"2122rookies.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter(G &gt; 32)\n\nrookiemeanminutes &lt;- read_csv(\"newnewmeanminutes.csv\")\n\nggplot(rookiemeanminutes, aes(x = year, y = mean_minutes)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 25)\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n    labs(y = \"Average Minutes per Game by Rookies\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       title = \"The 2024 rookie class doesn't see the court\",\n       subtitle = \"This years rookies play just over 16 minutes per game while the previous four classes played over 19 minutes per game.\",\n       caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Anthony Rubek\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last four rookie classes had nearly identical average minutes per game with all coming around the 19 minute range. However, this years class sees a deep fall off to just over 16 minutes per game. While there is a lot of time for this number to change, it doesn’t look promising as the chart only uses players who have appeared in at least 40% of their teams games, no matter the year.\nFinally, let’s do a deep dive on this years top rookies compared to last years.\n\n\nCode\nrookies24topscorers &lt;- read_csv(\"2425rookies.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter((Player == \"Jared McCain\" |\n    Player == \"Jaylen Wells\" |\n    Player == \"Dalton Knecht\" |\n    Player == \"Zaccharie Risacher\" |\n    Player == \"Stephon Castle\"))\n\nrookies23topscorers &lt;- read_csv(\"2324rookies.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter((Player == \"Victor Wembanyama\" |\n    Player == \"Brandon Miller\" |\n    Player == \"Keyonte George\" |\n    Player == \"GG Jackson II\" |\n    Player == \"Scoot Henderson\"))\n\nrookiescores &lt;- rbind(rookies24topscorers, rookies23topscorers)\n\nrookiescorers &lt;- rookiescores |&gt; \n  select(\n    Player,\n    PTSPG,\n    ASTPG,\n    TRBPG\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Sum = PTSPG + ASTPG + TRBPG \n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Sum))\n\nrookiescorers |&gt; gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    PTSPG = \"Points per game\",\n    ASTPG = \"Assists per game\",\n    TRBPG = \"Rebounds per game\",\n    Sum = \"Sum\") |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Last year's rookies outplaying this year's\",\n    subtitle = \"Of the top five scorers of each class, only McCain ranks with the 2023 guys.\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n   tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Anthony Rubek  |  **Source:** Basketball Reference\") \n  )  |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n    opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#E03A3E\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Jared McCain\"\n    ) ) |&gt; \n      opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#E03A3E\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Stephon Castle\"\n  ) ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#E03A3E\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Zaccharie Risacher\"\n    )) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#E03A3E\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Jaylen Wells\"\n    ) ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#E03A3E\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Dalton Knecht\"\n    ) )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year's rookies outplaying this year's\n\n\nOf the top five scorers of each class, only McCain ranks with the 2023 guys.\n\n\nPlayer\nPoints per game\nAssists per game\nRebounds per game\nSum\n\n\n\n\nVictor Wembanyama\n21.4\n3.9\n10.6\n35.9\n\n\nBrandon Miller\n17.3\n2.4\n4.3\n24.0\n\n\nScoot Henderson\n14.0\n5.4\n3.1\n22.5\n\n\nJared McCain\n16.0\n2.6\n2.5\n21.1\n\n\nKeyonte George\n13.0\n4.4\n2.8\n20.2\n\n\nGG Jackson II\n14.6\n1.2\n4.1\n19.9\n\n\nStephon Castle\n11.3\n3.7\n2.6\n17.6\n\n\nJaylen Wells\n12.2\n1.9\n3.4\n17.5\n\n\nZaccharie Risacher\n11.6\n1.4\n3.5\n16.5\n\n\nDalton Knecht\n11.6\n1.1\n3.4\n16.1\n\n\n\nBy: Anthony Rubek | Source: Basketball Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the top five leading scorers from both classes and adding their points per game, rebounds per game, and assists per game together, 2023 nearly sweeps the 2024. McCain is the only player to disrupt the table while the other four rookies are at least two points below the rest in the sum.\nOverall, the 2024 rookie class is living up to the expectations of being considered one of the worst in NBA history. However, there is still a lot of time for these players especially McCain to develop and eventually turn into star. After all, the 2013 NBA rookie class was once thought of to be on the worst ever, only for Giannis Antetokounmpo to come out of it."

    "text": "Atlanta Hawks point guard Trae Young is an established star in the NBA. This past season, he averaged 25.7 points per game and a career-high 10.8 assists per game. His play also earned in a spot in the NBA All Star Game.\nHowever, when big media outlets yearly top 100 NBA player lists came out this past summer, Young found himself placed lower than his stats suggest. ESPN had Young at No. 37 on its ranking while CBS had him at No. 35. Both lists had him as the 12th ranked point guard, placing him behind the following: Dallas’ Luka Dončić, Golden State’s Stephen Curry, New York’s Jalen Brunson, Milwaukee’s Damian Lillard, Indiana’s Tyrese Haliburton, Memphis’ Ja Morant, Philadelphia’s Tyrese Maxey, Denver’s Jamal Murray, Sacramento’s De’Aaron Fox, Dallas’ Kyrie Irving, and Boston’s Jrue Holiday.\nLooking over key statistics from the 2023-24 season as well as the early results of the 2024-25 campaign, it is easy to tell that Young is greatly underrated by the media.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\nYoung’s most known trait has been his passing. Ever since he entered the league in 2018, Young has been near the top of the league in assists.

He would have finished even higher if he had played all 82 games.\nWhat about defense? By far the biggest knock on the three-time all star’s game has been his defending.
