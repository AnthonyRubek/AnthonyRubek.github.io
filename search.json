    "text": "Atlanta Hawks point guard Trae Young is an established star in the NBA. This past season, he averaged 25.7 points per game and a career-high 10.8 assists per game. His play also earned in a spot in the NBA All Star Game.\nHowever, when big media outlets yearly top 100 NBA player lists came out this past summer, Young found himself placed lower than his stats suggest. ESPN had Young at No. 37 on its list while CBS had him at No. 35. Both lists had him as the 12th ranked point guard behind the following: Dallas’ Luka Doncic, Golden State’s Stephen Curry, New York’s Jalen Brunson, Milwaukee’s Damian Lillard, Indiana’s Tyrese Haliburton, Memphis’ Ja Morant, Philadelphia’s Tyrese Maxey, Denver’s Jamal Murray, Sacramento’s De’Aaron Fox, Dallas’ Kyrie Irving, and Boston’s Jrue Holiday.\nLooking over key statistics from the 2023-24 season as well as the early results of the 2024-25 campaign, it is easy to tell that Young is greatly underrated by the media.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\nYoung’s most known trait has been his passing. Ever since he entered the league in 2018, Young has been near the top of the league in assists. This didn’t change last season, despite him missing time.\n\n\nCode\nNBA23total &lt;- read_csv(\"NBAtotals2324.csv\")\n\nTraeYoung &lt;- NBA23total |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Trae Young\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = NBA23total, aes(x = G, y = AST), color = \"black\") + \n  geom_point(data = TraeYoung, aes(x = G, y = AST), color = \"#E03A3E\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = TraeYoung,\n    aes(x = G, y = AST, label = Player),\n    color = \"black\"\n   ) + theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"Total Assists\",\n       x = \"Games Played\",\n       title = \"Trae Young passes the ball like no other\",\n       subtitle = \"Despite playing in only 54 games, Young still finished in the top 10 in total assists\",\n       caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Anthony Rubek\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung’s 583 assists put him at eighth in the league. He would have finished even higher if he had played all 82 games.\nWhat about defense? By far the biggest knock on the three-time all star’s game has been his defending. However, Young has improved a lot over time with his steals per game showing that.\n\n\nCode\nnba2324 &lt;- read_csv(\"NBApergame2324.csv\")\n\nnba2324G &lt;- nba2324 |&gt; \n  filter(\n    G &gt;= 50\n  )\n\nTrae &lt;- nba2324G |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Trae Young\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data = nba2324G,\n    aes(x = Pos, y = STL),\n    color = \"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data = Trae,\n    aes(x = Pos, y = STL),\n    color = \"#E03A3E\"\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data = Trae,\n    aes(x = Pos, y = STL, label = Player),\n    color = \"black\") +\n  labs(x = \"Position\",\n       y = \"Steals per Game\",\n       title = \"Trae Young is a pest on defense\",\n       subtitle = \"The Hawks point guard was one of the better players at his position when it came to steals per game in 2023-2024\",\n       caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference | By Anthony Rubek\"\n       ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung’s 1.3 steals per game is more than FINISH\nThe top 100 players lists came out before the season started, serving as a prediction of who will be the best this coming year. Three weeks in, we can see how Young fares compared to the 12 point guards ranked above him.\n\n\nCode\nNBA25 &lt;- read_csv(\"NBApergame2425.csv\")\n\nnbapointguards &lt;- NBA25 |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Player == \"Trae Young\" |\n    Player == \"Jamal Murray\" |\n    Player == \"Jrue Holiday\" |\n    Player == \"De'Aaron Fox\" |\n    Player == \"Damian Lillard\" |\n    Player == \"Kyrie Irving\" |\n    Player == \"Tyrese Maxey\" |\n    Player == \"Tyrese Haliburton\" |\n    Player == \"Ja Morant\" |\n    Player == \"Jalen Brunson\" |\n    Player == \"Stephen Curry\" |\n    Player == \"Luka Dončić\")\n\nnbapointguardsnew &lt;- nbapointguards |&gt; \n  select(\n    Player,\n    PTS,\n    AST\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    TotalPointsandAssists = PTS + AST\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TotalPointsandAssists))\n\nnbapointguardsnew |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    PTS = \"Points per game\",\n    AST = \"Assists per game\",\n    TotalPointsandAssists = \"Total points and assists per game\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Trae Young stacks up well against fellow point guards\",\n    subtitle = \"The star player for the Hawks is ahead of all but one of the point guards ranked above him in preseason Top 100 lists\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n   tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Anthony Rubek  |  **Source:** Basketball Reference\") \n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n    opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#E03A3E\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Trae Young\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrae Young stacks up well against fellow point guards\n\n\nThe star player for the Hawks is ahead of all but one of the point guards ranked above him in preseason Top 100 lists\n\n\nPlayer\nPoints per game\nAssists per game\nTotal points and assists per game\n\n\n\n\nLuka Dončić\n28.8\n8.0\n36.8\n\n\nTrae Young\n23.9\n11.5\n35.4\n\n\nDamian Lillard\n27.3\n6.7\n34.0\n\n\nTyrese Maxey\n27.6\n3.9\n31.5\n\n\nJalen Brunson\n24.0\n6.1\n30.1\n\n\nJa Morant\n20.6\n9.1\n29.7\n\n\nDe'Aaron Fox\n24.6\n4.6\n29.2\n\n\nKyrie Irving\n23.7\n4.8\n28.5\n\n\nStephen Curry\n19.7\n6.2\n25.9\n\n\nJamal Murray\n18.2\n4.7\n22.9\n\n\nTyrese Haliburton\n14.7\n7.7\n22.4\n\n\nJrue Holiday\n12.7\n3.8\n16.5\n\n\n\nBy: Anthony Rubek | Source: Basketball Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung has exceeded projections so far, leading all point guards in assists per game while coming in at sixth in points per game. It is clear that Young should not have been ranked around the range of guys like Jrue Holiday (No. 36 ESPN, No. 32 CBS) and Jamal Murray (No. 31 ESPN, No. 34 CBS). Instead, Young should have been in discussions with the top of the list like Luka Dončić (No. 2 ESPN, No. 3 CBS)."
